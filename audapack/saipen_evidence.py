"""Bounded, protocol-aware collection of SAIPEN audit evidence.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
AUDAPACK's Git inventory is built from ``git ls-files`` plus
``git ls-files --others --exclude-standard``. Git-ignored material is absent
by construction -- which is correct for caches and build output, and wrong
for protocol memory. A project carrying ``.saipen/*`` in ``.gitignore`` hid
its entire canonical lifecycle from the inventory, so a package could ship
``IDENTITY.md`` plus one stale active intake receipt and nothing able to
contradict it, while the archive manifest still reported
``accounting_reconciled: true`` -- because the missing files were never
DISCOVERED, so the invariant ``discovered == included + excluded + failed``
held over material nobody had looked at.

The fix is NOT to expose ``.saipen`` to Git. Publication visibility and
audit evidence are separate concerns, and widening ``.gitignore`` would put
private working memory one ``git add -A`` away from a public commit.

Instead SAIPEN declares its own evidence in ``.saipen/MANIFEST.json``
(``saipen audit manifest --write``) and this module collects exactly what
that contract names. Bounded by construction:

* one stat to find the manifest;
* only directories the manifest names are walked, each with its own cap;
* symlinked directories are never followed, so no path escapes the project;
* paths the contract marks non-exportable are refused even if a directory
  rule would otherwise sweep them.

No unrestricted walk of ignored trees is introduced, so packing cost for
projects without SAIPEN is unchanged.

WHAT DECIDES THE VERDICT
------------------------
Collection DISCOVERS evidence; the verdict is about the ARCHIVE. `evaluate`
therefore takes the set of paths that actually survived into the package, and
a snapshot is COMPLETE only when every artifact the contract requires is in
that set:

* the mandatory documents (STATE/BOARD/LOG/IDENTITY);
* conditional material the contract makes required BECAUSE IT EXISTS
  (`.saipen/logs/**` and friends) -- discovery is not inclusion, so an
  explicit exclude, a hard-safety rule or a policy omission downstream of
  collection all count as the evidence being absent;
* the contract document itself, so the verdict stays re-derivable from the
  archive alone.

Optional material that is omitted is REPORTED and never degrades authority,
because the contract already declared its absence honest. A containment cap
hit on conditional material does degrade authority: that is required evidence
left behind rather than a policy choice about optional bulk.

CITED EVIDENCE (SRC-054)
------------------------
Directory rules only find what the contract names, so a surface the contract
forgot was never discovered and its loss could never be counted: Problip's
archive read COMPLETE with 142 of 142 evidence files while the PERF-001 proof
its LOG and archived coverage cited was not in it. Collection therefore also
reads the closure records the contract declares as citation carriers and
treats every cited path as required evidence -- collected when it exists,
reported as omitted when the archive lacks it or the disk never had it.

A citation is the project-relative token ``<memory_root>/<surface>/<path>``
inside a declared carrier. A token that continues a longer path (another
project's absolute path) is not one, and source bodies and derived contracts
are never carriers, because they quote the user. A citation can only ADD a
requirement, so stray prose fails closed; the remedy for a citation of proof
that will never exist is a file at that path saying so.

A contract that predates the ``references`` block gets the rules SAIPEN
publishes since SRC-054 (``rules_source: consumer_default``); otherwise every
project whose installed protocol has not regenerated its manifest yet would
keep reproducing the false COMPLETE.

CONTRACT VERSIONS (SUPPORTED_CONTRACT_VERSIONS)
----------------------------------------------
The protocol owns the contract and bumps ``contract_version`` when its SHAPE
changes. This consumer therefore keeps an explicit supported set and one
parser per version (``parse_contract_v1`` / ``parse_contract_v2``), rather than
a single parser with a magic constant: a version it does not implement is
refused -- by the contract's own ``compatibility`` policy -- instead of being
reinterpreted through the newest shape it happens to know.

What v2 added over v1 was taken from the real generator's output, not
inferred: the contract/generator version, and ``quarantine/`` in
``evidence.non_exportable`` (``V2_NON_EXPORTABLE_BASELINE``). Everything else
-- ``required``, ``compatibility``, ``references``, the mandatory-file objects,
the bounded conditional/optional directory rules -- is identical in both, so
both versions are read by shared code and differ only where the contract
differs. A document that declares one version is never read through the
other's rules.

FORWARD COMPATIBILITY (MILESTONE K)
-----------------------------------
A newer-than-implemented contract is no longer hard-failed merely for being
numerically newer. ``check_capabilities`` probes whether every capability this
consumer depends on for safe inventory and packaging is structurally present:
project identity, include/exclude rules, credential protection, inventory root,
evidence requirements, and integrity semantics. A document that passes is
admitted as ``COMPATIBLE_DEGRADED`` and read through the newest implemented
parser (additive unknown metadata is tolerated and preserved, never rewritten).
Only a newer contract that DROPS or RESHAPES a required capability is refused
as ``INCOMPATIBLE_UNSAFE``, with the exact missing capability reported.

A REFUSED version is a CONSUMER defect, not a project defect: the operator's
project is fine and ``saipen audit manifest --write`` would only rewrite the
same newer contract. ``contract_unknown_detail`` is the single wording for
older-than-implemented refusals; ``check_capabilities_detail`` covers the
forward-compatibility cases. Callers (the packing gate, the operator message)
reuse those rather than inventing repair advice that does not repair anything.

    FAIL CLOSED: a project that IS a SAIPEN project and cannot produce the
    evidence its contract requires is reported PROTOCOL_INCOMPLETE. It is never
    silently downgraded to a healthy-looking package, because a reviewer
    reading a healthy package trusts what it does not contain.

    ``included`` is the FINAL package view: the set of source-relative paths
    that actually survived into the archive. When it is supplied, the verdict
    is decided by what the archive CONTAINS rather than by what the collector
    once found. That distinction is the whole point: discovery succeeding says
    nothing about an explicit exclude, a hard-safety rule, a fidelity budget
    trim or a size policy removing the file afterwards, and a "complete"
    verdict over an archive that lost required evidence is a lie a reviewer
    cannot detect from the archive itself.

    The rule, in one sentence:

        required = mandatory(contract) + conditional(discovered, because the
        contract makes a PRESENT artifact required); an archive missing any
        required artifact is never authoritative.

    ``reason_for(rel)`` lets the inventory name WHY a particular file was
    dropped (its own reason vocabulary), so the omission is actionable instead
    of merely counted. Optional evidence is reported and never degrades the
    verdict -- the contract said its absence is honest.
