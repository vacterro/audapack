# T-277 evidence — one effective launch inventory (red proof, hermetic green, live read-only)

## 1. RED proof — the controls fail when the repair is disabled

The repair is one function: `launch_federation.sync_effective_launchers`. Neutering it (answer `standalone`, touch nothing) restores the exact split-brain the source describes, and the controls fail:

```
  [FAIL(red)] every canonical account appears exactly once, keyed by account_id
  [FAIL(red)] no static Codex/Claude/Antigravity account authority remains
  [FAIL(red)] the canonical account is launchable with no manual static binding
  [PASS] one identity, one record (no local residue beside the projection)

inventory with the repair disabled: ['opencode', 'freebuff', 'cline', 'main_codex', 'main_codex2', 'main_codex3_free', 'claude1', 'claude2', 'antigravity', 'zcode']
controls red: 3/4
```

Control 4 (one identity, one record for `.claude`) stays green under the neutered reconciler on purpose: it guards the MERGE rule (an unbound local residue must not survive beside the bound canonical projection), which is exercised by the sync being disabled just as much as by it running. It is kept as a contract control, not as this repair's red evidence.

## 2. GREEN — hermetic suite

```

## 3. LIVE read-only reconciliation against the installed registry

Run: `python audit/t277_live_reconciliation.py` (read-only; no account added, removed, hidden or launched; the config it reconciles is a throwaway in-memory AppConfig).
