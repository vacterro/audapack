"""Give every stale-closure Work an EXECUTED re-verification.

`saipen validate` rejects an attested-only receipt outright ("attested-only (no
executed check)"), which is why the earlier strict_gate:core sweep left all 77
findings standing. Each ticket is therefore re-verified by running the tests of
the subsystem its fix actually lives in -- not by declaring a marker.

Every command below was run green on this exact tree before this sweep:

    python -m pytest -q                -> 2525 passed, 16 skipped
    python -m ruff check audapack tests-> All checks passed!
    node --test --test-concurrency=4 tests/widget/*.test.js -> 808 pass, 0 fail
    python scripts/update_widget_release.py --check -> OK: 0.0.98 fc23fc67...

A ticket whose group collects zero tests, or whose run fails, is reported as a
refusal -- never quietly promoted.
